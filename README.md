# Developer Guidelines for GitHub by CapgeminiNorway  
A shared repo about docs and info for Capgemini developers  

## What's this?   

The goal is to have *a common template* used by all repos (public/private) shared under [CapgeminiNorway](https://github.com/CapgeminiNorway)     

Developers need autonomy and optionality, thus those guidelines are not set of rules but *just a gentle template to ease communication.*

- [How to write good commit-messages](HOW-commit-messages.md)
