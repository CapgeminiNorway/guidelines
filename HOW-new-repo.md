# Do you want to have repositories in GitHub/CapgeminiNorway?  

Here comes a short checklist we need to follow GitHub.

## Licensing
We have chosen MIT as standard license. All repos [must have a `LICENSE.md`](LICENSING.md).

## Readme
We have [standard README](README.template.md) which you can copy and use.

## Show & Share  
Always but always think about showability of your work.  
The easy yet effective way is to release a functional demo, e.g. deploy to Heroku or some place like this. Then share a link with your colleagues.     
In most cases, you learn about new frameworks and you craft a repo as an example. Well, go ahead and open source it! :)    

## .gitignore  
We have [standard .gitignore](.gitignore) which you can copy and use.  

## Clean Code  
The best documentation is the codebase itself! :)  
Code itself is our common language.  
Therefore, write clean code, make sure it contains easy to understand comments, and also have easy to browse commit messages.
