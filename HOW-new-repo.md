# Do you want to have repositories in GitHub/CapgeminiNorway?  

Here comes a short checklist we need to follow GitHub.

## Licensing
We have chosen MIT as standard license. All repos [must have a `LICENSE.md`](LICENSING.md).

## Readme
We have [standard README](README.template.md) which you can copy and use.

## .gitignore  
We have [standard .gitignore](.gitignore) which you can copy and use.
